# Synopsis
In this game, you play as Rick, who's now hellbent on collecting all the different types of Mortys out in the universe, and to be the very best.
Rick captures Mortys with no Ricks in order to increase his collection. This game plays like pokemon, but the difficulty roughly stays the same, instead of it scaling per area. You can do events to collect rare Mortys and etc.

# Game Play Summary
All in all, i loved playing this game for the first couple of weeks when i got it, but it can kinda lose its luster after a while, considering that the difficulty never changes, so youre always in danger of losing; there is no real way to get a level advantage of enemy playes except by maybe 2-5, which does make a difference, but not enough to make the player feel like theyre doing something right.
Would play again once semester is over
## Playability
This game has a long playability, since you can find many versions of Morty, and fight many versions of Rick as well. Theres a touch of the show involved, so it doesnt feel like a third party game.Every season theyll add more Mortys to the mix in order to keep the collection going, which makes it more fun
### Single/Multiplayer
This game is single player, though i believe they added a PvP function(you have to be a certain level to play that)
### Controls
It has on screen controls like a D-pad, and has a menu to interact with your items and Mortys

# Bugs
So saving is a huge issue with this game; you have to make sure to save every time you leave the game, otherwise youre going to lose your progress and it really sucks having to climb back up the ladder. I believe there should be a autosave function, or maybe a cloud save, since you can sometimes to forget.
# Final Thoughts
Again, this game is fun since the amount of Mortys to collect are ridiculous, and the variations are funny to look at, even with their descriptions added. I would recommend this game to more of my friends if theyre interested in this kind of game, or just looking to pass the time.
