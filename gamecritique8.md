# Game Play Summary
## Playability
This game has huge replayability; you can take different approaches to the same mission, and its never the same mission twice in a row( the game moves assests around so that you never whats in store for you. Again, you can take a mission in numerous ways, whether it be loud or silent. It has objectives and hidden things in the level for the players to search for and many more to keep the player entertained for hours on end

### Controls
You can use either a controller or a keyboard; the usual inputs, nothing that sticks out in terms of controls that are different from the norm
# Bugs
When playing the map Shadow Raid( a map that can only be completed in stealth) the enemies were alerted immediately if i brought a weapon in the Thanotos 50 cal. with a supressor on. It had only happened a couple of times in a couple of day seesions, but it doesnt seem to be appearing anymore
# Final Thoughts
Overall a fun game, but i do have complaints when it comes to how the style can get repetitive, and that the new maps do offer a new experience and a new way to do things, but certain maps that come from the community seem to have a better time getting traciton than some of the ones that come out from this company. Maybe with the new packs coming in, itll improve the state of the game.
