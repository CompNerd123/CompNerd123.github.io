# Summary

This game is about beating the drums in rhythym to command your army. As the game moves progresses, you are given more and more rhythyms to choose from so that you can play with different patterns or style, making each mission fun and unique every playthrough. After playing this game both on PSP and PS4, there are a couple of things that could be tested.

One of the major problems with Rhythym or Beat games is the response time to a player input vs when the game registers when the input was issued. The game does seem to have a tendency to fluctuate its rhythym, or in my case, when a level plays music that doesnt match the rhythym, it can players off, making the level more difficult. Another issue that could be looked at is the hit markers on bosses, as weapons tend to fall through or pass an enemy, dealing no damage or not registering any. 

Making sure that the players hit their mark(both rhythym and enemy) is necessary to make this game fun, and is one of the few things needing testing.
# Final Thoughts

All in all, the game is fun and still holds up to standards in the community; a hidden gem from the PSP era. Glad to see it ported to PS4, and hopefully the other titles will soon follow suit.
