# Synopsis
just like its predeccesor, it focuses on you traveling across the us to a safe haven, but with much more rng events. A twist on the former formula, it adds a increased difficulty and heavily relies on choices made early in the game. A fun, difficult game.

# Game Play Summary
A fun game, i had trouble with understanding the shooting mechanic, which the controls were inverted for some odd reason.
Zombies kicked my butt, and the furthest i got was 60%. I eventually died and decided to play again, which to my demise, never made it
past the halfway mark of the game.
## Playability
it has a lot of playabilty as it the events are randomized throughout, so no experience is the same on each playthrough
### Single/Multiplayer
Single Player
### Controls
an assortment of controls, ranging from selecting items to buy, from shooting and moving up and down, left and right. It has a shooting function, which is set inward, meaning that it can be difficcult to understand on how to shoot.

# Bugs
no bugs were found. just some minor misshaps on my behalf.
# Final Thoughts
Honestly a fun game, but a bit dry for me. When it comes to strategy, i prefer games like LOL or Overwatch. When it comes down to games like Oregon or Organ trail, it loses its luster real quick, though fun.
