# Synopsis
Build and create refineries in this mining game. go lower and lower, and level up your weapons to get past the bosses of this game.

# Game Play Summary
I had a decent amount of fun by collecting resources and building items to further speed up the game. Its a really neat way to pass the time, like Pokemon Go or Clash of Clans. 
Many times i did have a slight annoyance with waiting for items to complete building, but that usually comes with games like these.
A nice resource management game, and one that doesnt gouge your pockets to complete the game.

## Playability
You can play for the first couple of hours having fun, afterwards its just checking up on your machines and 
collect resources since theyre are difficulty spikes. Once you reach a certain level, you can get past areas/bosses.

### Single/Multiplayer
Single player
### Controls
Swipe; you use screen buttons to use weapons/ collect resources

# Bugs
When you leave your robots to collect resources and dont let the game load the entire scene and access your inventory, you get double resources collected.
Game sometimes doesnt register damage if you spam the button.
# Final Thoughts
This game is a nice way to pass time when youre bored out of your mind. Other times it is a drag to wait for items to complete building,
and you have to wait with very expensive ways to speed up the process
