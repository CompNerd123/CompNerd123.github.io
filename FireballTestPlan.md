# Fireball Test Plan

# Section 1: General Information
* Summary

Fireball is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape made of blocks of different materials. As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and can set fire to more and more different types of blocks. The fireball the player controls can also rise up in height and the hotter the player gets, the higher they can jump in this fashion.
On each field (level) the player has an ultimate goal of igniting the torch (brazier) and thus clearing the field – but the torch is generally positioned at a high point and out of reach. The player must use a combination of platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for instance, by burning the supports under the torch down to the ground) in order to clear the field.
Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy to learn but engaging play experience.
* Test Objectives

To find any hidden bugs within the game; no things that can be broken will be left in the game. Make sure game is user-friendly.
* Enviroment Community

PC environment

* Acceptance Criteria

Effortless play originating from a simple control scheme.

Unique experience – the only game to be based around setting fires.

Varied solutions to the mini-puzzles as the player works out the best places to start fires.

Exploration of small environments.

# Section 2:Plan
* Test Description

Will do testing on controls, and the ball heating up. Ball will be tested to see if the increase it receives properly affects the block it touches. Controls will be tested to see response time to player input and to see whether controls are functioning properly.
* Test Team

Rick Sanchez

Morty Smith

Mr.Meeseeks

Jerry Smith(for emotional support?)
* Milestones

Test for controls begins 4/20/17

Completed Control Testing 5/20/17

Testing for user-friendliness begins 5/24/17

Completed testing for userfriendliness 6/8/17

Proper increase heat testing 6/10/17

Completed Proper increase heat testing 7/1/17

* Budgets

Funds given by Sony, a total of 3.50

* Testing 

Szechuan Sauce to hold in my inner demons

A Dell Tower and Screen built in 2017 

Unity engine

Unreal engine

* Testing Materials

Will be expecting testers to write a small summary of bugs found in game while being tested

Everytime a bug is found, will be added to a document and recorded for future reference

* Test Training

Personnel will be trained in basic coding and Java

Will do blackbox and whitebox testing, userability, and performance testing.

# Section 3:Specifications and Evaluations
* Requirement Specifications

Will need access to Steam to make sure that game wont be corrupted or mistreated in any way upon delivery

Sony to see past codes that were used in the past, talk to people who worked on the game before

Testing will be done based on difficulty of change needed. Will have a 1-2 day relaxation period to ensure that personnel arent being taxed on.
