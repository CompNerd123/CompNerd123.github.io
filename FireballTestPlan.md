# Section 1: General Information
* Summary

Fireball is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape made of blocks of different materials. As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and can set fire to more and more different types of blocks. The fireball the player controls can also rise up in height and the hotter the player gets, the higher they can jump in this fashion.
On each field (level) the player has an ultimate goal of igniting the torch (brazier) and thus clearing the field â€“ but the torch is generally positioned at a high point and out of reach. The player must use a combination of platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for instance, by burning the supports under the torch down to the ground) in order to clear the field.
Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy to learn but engaging play experience.
* Test Objectives

To find any hidden bugs within the game; no things that can be broken will be left in the game. Make sure game is user-friendly.
